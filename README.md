# inkscape-0-92-5
Inkscape 0.92.5 PKGUBILD script for Arch Linux

The patch provided with this `PKGBUILD` is hacked together to get Inkscape to compile at all.
I probably only use a very small feature set of Inkscape, so I figured I don't need a fully functional version to begin with.
However, what I was desperately missing is e.g. the quick-zoom buttons that were dropped out starting with Inkscape 1.0.
This version still has them :-)
